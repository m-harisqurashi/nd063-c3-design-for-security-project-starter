1.  Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

    UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce:
        i-09544584a696bbb9b is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.202. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.

2.  Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
    This finding is generated only through monitoring traffic on port 22. If your SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated.

    From AWS documentation:
        Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following Data sources: 
        -   VPC Flow Logs 
        -   AWS CloudTrail management event logs
        -   Cloudtrail S3 data event logs
        -   DNS logs

    In this particular case, VPC Flow Logs would show the attack attempts.
