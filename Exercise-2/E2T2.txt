Excersice: 
    1.  Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project. 
    2.  Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1.  Vulnerabilities:
    [CIS.1.12]	Ensure no root account access key exists
    [CIS.4.3]   Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
    [CIS.2.1]	Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions

2.  Recommendations:
    Remove root access for AWS access keys
    Default security group for VPC should be closed and should restricts all traffic
    EC2 instances in your account should be managed by AWS Systems Manager
    SSL & server-side encryption should be enabled on S3 buckets
    EBS volumes must be encrypted
