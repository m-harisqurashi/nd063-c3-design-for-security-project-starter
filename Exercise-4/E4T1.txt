Q1: Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet
    1. We should change our security group settings to restrict ssh connections from internet
    2. We can remove the ability for ssh login with password
    3. Implement stronger password complexity

Q2: Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
    Security/Access policy for s3 buckets can be altered by specifying explicit free bucket only. This will remove access for S3's secret bucket.
